### This file is an example authorization file for svnserve.
### Its format is identical to that of mod_authz_svn authorization
### files.
### As shown below each section defines authorizations for the path and
### (optional) repository specified by the section name.
### The authorizations follow. An authorization line can refer to a
### single user, to a group of users defined in a special [groups]
### section, or to anyone using the '*' wildcard.  Each definition can
### grant read ('r') access, read-write ('rw') access, or no access
### ('').
